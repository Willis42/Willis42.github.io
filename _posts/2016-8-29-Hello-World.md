title: Hello World!
---

Yay for unoriginal first-blog-post title! Today is the inception of my blog for CS 373 - Software Engineering at UT with Dr. Fraij. This class has been recommended to me by many Computer Science students at UT who have taken it in the past, and I've decided to take this class during my senior year so as to (hopefully) get the most out of it, and also so that I might hold on to some of this knowledge when I get out into the workforce!

We haven't made much progress in the class yet, since it's a Tuesday/Thursday class and our first class was last Thursday, but we did talk a bit about what all will be covered in the course, and even dove into the first assignment about the Collatz Conjecture. The problem itself is relatively simple, but the scope of the project - namely getting used to the new workflow Dr. Fraij wants us to follow for all of our projects in this class, and successfully learning and integrating the different tools we will use (Travis CI and Sphere Online Judging are both tools that are new to me) - should prove to be sufficiently large for a first assignment.

Thus far, I've looked into the public repo for our first project a little bit, but I want to wait until our second class before really diving in and writing code for it - the instructions for the project are rather clear-cut, but it appears from looking at the schedule that we will be going over some of the steps (or at least the tools themselves) in class. Since our first day was mostly just an introduction and going over the syllabus, it's hard to say for sure what exactly this week will entail until we've got a better feel of the class and typical lecture content, but it looks like we'll be going over some coding conventions and stuff about unit tests. 

tip-of-the-week: Ubuntu 16.04 comes with python 3.5.1 pre-installed as the default for python3!
